Description :
Big Data Analysis is the process of examining large and complex datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that drive business and research decisions. Traditional data processing tools often struggle to handle such massive volumes of data efficiently. Apache Spark, combined with PySpark (Python API for Spark), provides a scalable, fast, and distributed computing framework for processing and analyzing Big Data.

This repository focuses on Big Data Analysis using PySpark, demonstrating data preprocessing, transformation, analysis, and visualization techniques. By leveraging distributed computing, PySpark allows organizations to process terabytes of data across multiple nodes, making it a powerful tool for real-world applications in finance, healthcare, retail, social media, and more.

Tools & Technologies Used:
1) Big Data Processing Framework (Pyspark)
2) Programming (Python)
3) Libraries (pandas & NumPy )

 Where We Use Big Data Analysis?
 1) Banking & Finance
 2) Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals
 3) E-commerce & Retail
 4) Social Media & Marketing
 5) Smart Cities & IoT
